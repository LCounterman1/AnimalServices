    <p>
        Animal Services was created to help animal owners keep track of appointment dates and reminders for
        animals and services to all types of animals. You can add your animals to a personal profile to track
        and maintain their health records. You can also access a list of clinics and register your animal for
        appointments for services provided through the clinics.
